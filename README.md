# React 19 useEffect Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `useEffect` hook in React 19 where it might run multiple times even when an empty dependency array is provided.  The expected behavior is for the effect to run only once after the initial render. This particular problem manifests itself when dealing with certain asynchronous operations or complex component lifecycles, and is subtle and difficult to track.  The solution provides a workaround to address this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the console output. You'll see that the effect runs multiple times.

## Solution

The solution provided addresses this potential problem. The root cause is likely due to unexpected re-renders or asynchronous actions that might not be immediately apparent.
